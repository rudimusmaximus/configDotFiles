# configDotFiles  

If already installed, this file is from the bare repo installed in .cfg folder in your $HOME directory. The parent repo is on [github](https://github.com/rudimusmaximus/configDotFiles). Read the **To Use** section for installation instructions.

## Intent

Have a repo from which to setup any new MacOS or Linux shell environment with familiar cli experience.

### How it works

Run the script under To Use section. The files from the repo are copied to your $HOME directory.

Most importantly, a `.bash_profile` sources the `.path`, `.extra`, `.exports` and makes a few other settings before also sourcing the `.bashrc` which itself sources the `.prompt`, `.aliases`, and `.functions` to ensure a consistent experience across interactive and non-interactive shells including SSH sessions.

These various .files and folders, divide settings/configurations into logical groups.
This sort of repo is comonly called a dot files repo - hence the repo name, but you will see other variations.

## To use  

In a fresh terminal, from your home directory:

```shell script will execute and delete itself
curl -sSf https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rudimusmaximus/cbb877cb5797b00d7fbb9ddc88e7f8b9/raw | bash
```
The script lives in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/rudimusmaximus/cbb877cb5797b00d7fbb9ddc88e7f8b9). Review first if you like.

Any backups of .files that would have been overwritten can be found in .cfg-install.sh
After you restart the terminal, type 'alias' to see our shortcuts. The cursor now has magic powers in git repos. And, nvm is assumed installed. 

## Further Considerations

### Assumed installed

Review the aliases for hints on tools assumed installed. On macOS, prefere Homebrew, download directly from source, or build when necessary after cloning project into a dictory under $HOME/projects. On Fedora, prefer dnf package manager, clone and build in similar directory, or use flatpack as last resort avoiding sources other than say RPM free and non-free.

**Preferred tools**

- nnn and then node and npm lts to start, use n-update to update
- nvim and it's required prerequisits
- bun.sh

**AFTER** confDotFiles installation

- complete .extra items for ssh, and github AND setup gpg for signing

### Additional background

See Atlassian's git tutorials for dot files last known (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) for using a bare cloned repo with a clever alias to manage your changes over time.

Our source repo's `.gitignore` includes .cfg to avoid recursive issues and does not include any IDE files.

**TIP** Two aliases are included in the repo to make a git command; type `config` or `cfg` and see the `.aliases` file for
more cfg commands.
