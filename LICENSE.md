PLEASE NOTE: this is a derivative work based on the repo at https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
from which we took a subset of dot files for customizing our bash.
Initially, .aliases, .bash_profile, .bash_prompt, .bashrc, .extra, and .hushlogin.  

Overtime, we may add other files from that project along with our customizations.
