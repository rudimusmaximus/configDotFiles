== macOS

=== So far

After a fresh install. My usual setup is for 'M1 Max' hardware with macOS and Fedora Asahi Remix. This log is on OCLP install of Sequoia on a late 2015 27" iMac.

==== Oct 1, 2024 Fresh install

TODO update with links
* Fresh install vs Open Core Legacy Patcher 2.0.2
* Safari only showing video at 1080, installed Brave; test video at 4k is fine; didn't test 5k yet.
* Installed SwitchResX for screen rotation if needed (while screen sharing will not work in portrait as intended It works but not like you want); must use on iMac standalone. This is OK if using ssh
* Using vi for this, let's fix that.

==== Oct 2, 2024 - setting up my dev flow

* Installed my custom font from ilovetypography.com (comic code family); see iCloud > Documents Order confirmation ILT-220517-36ab215.zip; unzip and use Font Book to add folder of license name and you are done. This is the font used by my terminal kitty w bash shell and customm nvim
* Installed Homebrew; go to https://brew.sh/ for latest info; see also https://docs.brew.sh
* Created new ssh key for this machine and add it to your github account
  * see https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
* Install latest bash, add it to list of shells, set it as default shell
* Install the kitty terminal
* Install a set of apps wit brew install kitty, fastfetch, asdf, bat, fzf

* Install tpm (tmux plugin manager) see https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm by cloning it
* Do not clone tmuxifier (it is in our path in the dot files) as our tmux config will install it provided we install tpm and then dot files; source the dot files, run tmux and run a leader + I command.
* install your own layouts we use private tmuxi-layouts to ~/.tmuxifier_layouts
* review but for now our .extra exports a variable telling tmuxifier where to find layouts
* also the .extra sets some bun related info for bun's binary lock files

* Install rudimusMaximus/ConfigDotFiles

=== Managing runtimes

having installed asdf

==== nodejs

TODO make some helper functions to manage the state of lts changes and installation and
remond curent state of node so user can manage. but make the updates and availability
of installed lts versions smoothly automated
see https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs

.commands for installing nodejs (node - each version comes with it's npm but we use bun pm for that)
[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git

# Before checking for aliases, update nodebuild to check for newly releasead versions
asdf nodejs update-nodebuild

asdf nodejs resolve lts
# outputs: 20.17.0

# Outputs the latest version installed locally which is a LTS
asdf nodejs resolve lts --latest-installed

# Outputs the latest version available for download which is a LTS
asdf nodejs resolve lts --latest-available

# Install the latest available version
asdf global nodejs latest

# we determined latest lts is 20.17.0
# SO, INSTALL TO ASDF
asdf install nodejs 20.17.0
# then set the global nodejs to 20.17.0
asdf global nodejs 20.17.0
----

==== asdf plugins

Use this list to find right url https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file#plugin-list

Then click to the pligin repository and confirm installation

So we ran :checkhealth in nvim to install what we needed. We needed luarocks wich neads lua 5.1 so
There was one for Lua and one for LuaJIT we want lua for compatibility as JIT if for performance as it converts the code to binary in realtime.
that site gave us

[source,bash]
----

asdf plugin-add lua https://github.com/Stratus3D/asdf-lua.git

----

THEN use the general instructions for working with asdf language plugin

[source,bash]
----

asdf list-all lua

----

this lists all the versions that we can install

[source,bash]
----
try 5.1.5 as it's the latest 5.1 series and checkhealth wants 5.1 but doesn't specify more info
asdf install lua 5.1
asdf global lua 5.1
----

do the same after adding the following plugins but use the latest if not specified otherwise by healthcheck
will add results when done by running

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin-add python
asdf plugin list --urls

----

SO ADD EACH repo, then use this pattern to install latest of the language or version you need

[source,bash]
----

asdf install python latest
asdf install python 3.12.7
# or just install 3.12.7 watch out for experiments lik with t in the version for now
# we just want nvim to be cool

----

then global if not local in working directory of a project

[source,bash]
----
asdf global python version you just installed
----

NOTE the link for python says asdf plugin install python without url oddly

TODO STOP php was best simply installed with brew, unclear how many of the items installed along the way of errors in making asdf php work.

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin-add php https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-php.git
----

note: check inside nvim :help provider-python
make sure bat ~/.tool-versions shows you installed it globally
it should after asdf global python 3.12.7 in our case
Then at a terminal: "python -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim"
or python3 if your system doesn't see python both should -V to the version you installed

===== golang
[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin add golang https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-golang.git
asdf install golang latest
asdf global golang latest
----

===== java

Be aware that brew can have openjdk and i don't think that's an issue and there is the mac one too so if you have issues study these facts.
Let's satisfy nvim java and javac requirements like this with asdf:

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin-add java https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java.git
asdf install java latest:adoptopenjdk-11
asdf global java latest:adoptopenjdk-11
----

===== Neovim

Use nightly and fallback is just to set the stable version to global.

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin add neovim
asdf install neovim stable
asdf install neovim nightly
asdf global neovim stable
# or
asdf global neovim nightly
----

Also, make use of the new aliases for this. Already in the dot files.

[source,bash]
----
alias update-nvim-stable='asdf uninstall neovim stable && asdf install neovim stable'
alias update-nvim-nightly='asdf uninstall neovim nightly && asdf install neovim nightly'

Here is the step-by-step guide to generate a new SSH key on your Raspberry Pi, add it to the SSH agent, and display the public key for deployment.

== Commands

=== Step 1: Generate a New SSH Key

This command creates a new, high-security `ed25519` key pair. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase, which is highly recommended for securing your private key.

Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run:

[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pi3b+
----

* `-t ed25519`: Specifies the `ed25519` algorithm, which is modern, secure, and fast.
* `-C "..."`: A comment to help you identify the key later. Using your email is a common practice.
* `-f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pi3b+`: Sets the filename for your new key pair. Two files will be created: `id_ed25519_pi3b+` (the private key) and `id_ed25519_pi3b+.pub` (the public key).

=== Step 2: Start the SSH Agent

The `ssh-agent` is a background program that handles your private keys and their passphrases. This command starts the agent for your current terminal session.

[source,bash]
----
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
----

=== Step 3: Add Your New Key to the SSH Agent

This step loads your new private key into the `ssh-agent`, so it can be used for authentication. You will be prompted to enter the passphrase you created in step 1.

[source,bash]
----
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pi3b+
----

NOTE: This command replaces the macOS-specific `ssh-add --apple-use-keychain`. The `--apple-use-keychain` flag is a feature of macOS to store your passphrase in the system's Keychain. On a Raspberry Pi, `ssh-add` on its own will cache your key's passphrase for the duration of your terminal session.

=== Step 4: (Optional but Recommended) Configure SSH to Use the New Key

You can configure SSH to automatically use this new key for specific hosts. This saves you from having to specify the key on the command line every time you connect.

Open the SSH config file with a text editor:

[source,bash]
----
nano ~/.ssh/config
----

Add a new entry like the following, replacing `github.com` with the server you want to connect to:

[source]
----
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain no
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pi3b+
----

Save the file by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+X], then kbd:[Y], and kbd:[Enter].

=== Step 5: Display the Public Key for Copying

To use your new SSH key, you need to add the *public key* to the server you want to access (e.g., in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on a remote server or in your GitHub account settings).

NOTE: The macOS `pbcopy` command is not available on Raspberry Pi OS. The simplest way to get the public key is to display it in the terminal, from where you can manually copy it.

[source,bash]
----
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pi3b+.pub
----

Your public key will be printed to the terminal. It will be a single line of text starting with `ssh-ed25519...`. Highlight this entire line of text and copy it. You can now paste this public key into the appropriate location on your server or service.
