== macOS

=== So far

After a fresh install. My usual setup is for 'M1 Max' hardware with macOS and Fedora Asahi Remix. This log is on OCLP install of Sequoia on a late 2015 27" iMac.

==== Oct 1, 2024 Fresh install

TODO update with links
* Fresh install vs Open Core Legacy Patcher 2.0.2
* Safari only showing video at 1080, installed Brave; test video at 4k is fine; didn't test 5k yet.
* Installed SwitchResX for screen rotation if needed (while screen sharing will not work in portrait as intended It works but not like you want); must use on iMac standalone. This is OK if using ssh
* Using vi for this, let's fix that.

==== Oct 2, 2024 - setting up my dev flow

* Installed my custom font from ilovetypography.com (comic code family); see iCloud > Documents Order confirmation ILT-220517-36ab215.zip; unzip and use Font Book to add folder of license name and you are done. This is the font used by my terminal kitty w bash shell and customm nvim
* Installed Homebrew; go to https://brew.sh/ for latest info; see also https://docs.brew.sh
* Created new ssh key for this machine and add it to your github account
  * see https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
* Install latest bash, add it to list of shells, set it as default shell
* Install the kitty terminal
* Install a set of apps wit brew install kitty, fastfetch, asdf, bat, fzf

* Install tpm (tmux plugin manager) see https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm by cloning it
* Do not clone tmuxifier (it is in our path in the dot files) as our tmux config will install it provided we install tpm and then dot files; source the dot files, run tmux and run a leader + I command.
* install your own layouts we use private tmuxi-layouts to ~/.tmuxifier_layouts
* review but for now our .extra exports a variable telling tmuxifier where to find layouts
* also the .extra sets some bun related info for bun's binary lock files

* Install rudimusMaximus/ConfigDotFiles

=== Commands

[source,bash]
----
# Homebrew The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux) but we will use dnf on Fedora
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# new key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "raul@raulfloresjr.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_imac
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
vi ~/.ssh/config
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_imac
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_imac.pub

# use your email, see setup for the config, and use the copy for adding new ssh to github (once for ssh and once for signing)
# also in your .extra add the key you created using the same key file name
[source,bash]
----
# Ensure the SSH agent is running
if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]; then
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
fi

# Add SSH key to agent using macOS Keychain
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_imac 2>/dev/null
# note that the same key file name does not mean same key (setup up each machines key for access and for signing)
# include a suffix to make clear the machines are different
----

# install latest bash with brew
brew install bash

# now setup the new BUT do not use /bin/bash which is the old installed version on some intel macs
# use the new version of bash from your homebrew install
/usr/local/bin/bash --version
# if you confirm then use this to add the shell ass follows first adding it to list of possible shells
sudo sh -c 'echo "/usr/local/bin/bash" >> /etc/shells'
# now change the default shell to Homebrew bash
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
# restart your computer now please

brew install kitty
brew install fastfetch
brew install asdf
brew install bat
brew install fzf
brew install tmux
brew install lazygit delta ripgrep wget

mkdir ~/.config/nvim
cd ~/.config/nvim
git clone git@github.com:RedCrowConsulting/nvim-config.git .
# when ready go to a project like cd configDotFiles and run nvim (it will install many items)

# https://github.com/oven-sh/bun install bun by cli not brew

== Managing runtimes
having installed asdf

=== nodejs

TODO make some helper functions to manage the state of lts changes and installation and
remond curent state of node so user can manage. but make the updates and availability
of installed lts versions smoothly automated
see https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs

.commands for installing nodejs (node - each version comes with it's npm but we use bun pm for that)
[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git

# Before checking for aliases, update nodebuild to check for newly releasead versions
asdf nodejs update-nodebuild

asdf nodejs resolve lts
# outputs: 20.17.0

# Outputs the latest version installed locally which is a LTS
asdf nodejs resolve lts --latest-installed

# Outputs the latest version available for download which is a LTS
asdf nodejs resolve lts --latest-available

# Install the latest available version
asdf global nodejs latest

# we determined latest lts is 20.17.0
# SO, INSTALL TO ASDF
asdf install nodejs 20.17.0
# then set the global nodejs to 20.17.0
asdf global nodejs 20.17.0
----

=== asdf plugins

Use this list to find right url https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins?tab=readme-ov-file#plugin-list

Then click to the pligin repository and confirm installation

So we ran :checkhealth in nvim to install what we needed. We needed luarocks wich neads lua 5.1 so
There was one for Lua and one for LuaJIT we want lua for compatibility as JIT if for performance as it converts the code to binary in realtime.
that site gave us

[source,bash]
----

asdf plugin-add lua https://github.com/Stratus3D/asdf-lua.git

----

THEN use the general instructions for working with asdf language plugin

[source,bash]
----

asdf list-all lua

----

this lists all the versions that we can install

[source,bash]
----
try 5.1.5 as it's the latest 5.1 series and checkhealth wants 5.1 but doesn't specify more info
asdf install lua 5.1
asdf global lua 5.1
----

do the same after adding the following plugins but use the latest if not specified otherwise by healthcheck
will add results when done by running

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin-add python
asdf plugin list --urls

----

SO ADD EACH repo, then use this pattern to install latest of the language or version you need

[source,bash]
----

asdf install python latest
asdf install python 3.12.7
# or just install 3.12.7 watch out for experiments lik with t in the version for now
# we just want nvim to be cool

----

then global if not local in working directory of a project

[source,bash]
----
asdf global python version you just installed
----

NOTE the link for python says asdf plugin install python without url oddly

TODO STOP php was best simply installed with brew, unclear how many of the items installed along the way of errors in making asdf php work.

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin-add php https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-php.git
----

note: check inside nvim :help provider-python
make sure bat ~/.tool-versions shows you installed it globally
it should after asdf global python 3.12.7 in our case
Then at a terminal: "python -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim"
or python3 if your system doesn't see python both should -V to the version you installed

==== golang
[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin add golang https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-golang.git
asdf install golang latest
asdf global golang latest
----

==== java

Be aware that brew can have openjdk and i don't think that's an issue and there is the mac one too so if you have issues study these facts.
Let's satisfy nvim java and javac requirements like this with asdf:

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin-add java https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java.git
asdf install java latest:adoptopenjdk-11
asdf global java latest:adoptopenjdk-11
----

==== Neovim

Use nightly and fallback is just to set the stable version to global.

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin add neovim
asdf install neovim stable
asdf install neovim nightly
asdf global neovim stable
# or
asdf global neovim nightly
----

Also, make use of the new aliases for this. Already in the dot files.

[source,bash]
----
alias update-nvim-stable='asdf uninstall neovim stable && asdf install neovim stable'
alias update-nvim-nightly='asdf uninstall neovim nightly && asdf install neovim nightly'
