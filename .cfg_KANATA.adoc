If you want to make use of the https://github.com/jtroo/kanata[Kanata] keyboard configuration utility, it's best to build it as follows. Note the configDotFiles project includes an advanced home row mod config. However, there can be permissions issues to overcome; so, let's see one way to do this.

Kanata requires privileged access on macOS to create and manage virtual HID devices. If you use Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice as the low-level driver, you must ensure that daemon is running as well. Below are instructions for both **debug** and **release** Kanata builds, two separate LaunchDaemons, and an optional shell function/aliases to quickly rebuild and update the Kanata binary.

First, let's setup an important requirement.

---
== ARCHIVE notes

Since moving to a hardware solution, I am documenting the changes here in case someone wants to review the kanata approach in the future.
Key reasons:

- portability and works on ios too
- easier programability
- no software install to use only to setup
- try a voyager keyboard from Canadian company zsa.io

=== .alias removals

``` bash
# start kanata session for our custom home mod setup see dotfiles in .config/kanata
# assumes asdf installed rust and cargo installed kanata and correct version of karabiner library and
# other security settings (see repo jtroo.kanata) and .cfg_KANATA.adoc
alias start_kanata_tmux_session='tmux new-session -s "kanata debug" "sudo $KANATA_DEBUG_BINARY -c $KANATA_CONFIG"'
# we still use this to start kanata in dev mode after a cargo build as we can watch the output
# having issues? try starting with external monitors off
alias skm='sudo $KANATA_DEBUG_BINARY -c $KANATA_CONFIG'
alias kcheck='ps aux | grep Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon | grep -v grep'

```

=== .extra removals

``` bash
# from intel imac with oclp macos

# Kanata alias needs these to start and config Kanta; defined here because various machines will differ
export KANATA_PATH="$HOME/project/kanata/target/debug/kanata"
export KANATA_CONFIG_PATH="/Users/rfjr/.config/kanata/home_row_mod_advanced.kbd"

# from m1max macos
# Kanata alias needs these to start and config Kanta; defined here because various machines will differ
# And these include project path assumptions
export KANATA_DEBUG_BINARY="$HOME/project/kanata/target/debug/kanata"
export KANATA_RELEASE_BINARY="$HOME/project/kanata/target/release/kanata"
export KANATA_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/kanata/home_row_mod_advanced.kbd"
export KANATA_DEBUG_LAUNCH_DAEMON="/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist"
export KANATA_RELEASE_LAUNCH_DAEMON="/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist"

```

=== .mrconfig (for mrupdate) removals


``` bash
# When you notice updates and can risk testing them, go to this directory
# and run 'cargo build' then test if working. the main concern if there are
# changes in the third party karabiner manager and it's daemon
# this runs with 'sudo target/debug/kanata --cfg <your_configuration_file>'
# see
# https://github.com/jtroo/kanata
# the Karabiner VirtualHiDDevice DriverKit which must be in sync with dev version of kanata but usually is latest
# https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/blob/main/dist/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice-5.0.0.pkg
# the daemon this makes possible must be started in same way as kanata with sudo or if permissions are setup correctly without
# see skm and skd aliases and tmuxifier layouts if you made them
# [project/kanata]
checkout = git clone 'git@github.com:jtroo/kanata.git' 'kanata'
disabled as we moved to keyboard  solution

```

=== Additional removals

- plist files listed below
- kanata repo
- Karabiner items
- on both machines followed instructions to remove setup approximately as follows

``` bash
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.karabiner-driverkit.plist
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.karabiner-driverkit.plist
/Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager deactivate
sudo rm -rf /Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app
sudo rm -rf "/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice"
```

=== rest of original install notes follow

---

== Karabiner VirtualHIDDevice Driver is required

The activation of the Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice is a one-time process. Once activated, the driver remains active across system restarts and does not require reactivation. The daemon, however, needs to be managed separately. To ensure the daemon starts automatically at system boot, you can create a LaunchDaemon plist file. This plist will handle the launching of the daemon but does not handle the activation process. Therefore, you only need to activate the driver once, and the LaunchDaemon will manage the daemon’s lifecycle thereafter.

. Install the latest from the git repo https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/blob/main/dist/ Get the latest currently that is Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice-5.0.0.pkg

. Activate the driver

Open terminal and run the following command:

``` bash
/Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager activate
```

. Launch the daemon with sudo OR Create a LaunchDaemon plist

You can start manually with an alias
``` bash
alias skd="sudo '/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/Applications/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon'"
```

. Create a LaunchDaemon plist so it starts automatically at boot

=== Setting up a LaunchDaemon for the Karabiner DriverKit Daemon

If you want the Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice daemon to start automatically at boot, you can create a LaunchDaemon plist that points to the daemon’s executable. On most systems, the Karabiner DriverKit daemon resides at:

`/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/Applications/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon`

. Run this to create the plist and pace it where it goes (you will have to enter your password)

``` bash
sudo tee /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.karabiner-driverkit.plist <<EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <!-- Unique label for the LaunchDaemon -->
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>org.rudimusmaximus.karabiner-driverkit</string>

  <!-- Command to run the Karabiner DriverKit daemon -->
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice/Applications/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon</string>
  </array>

  <!-- Start automatically at load (boot) -->
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>

  <!-- If it crashes or exits, launchd should restart it -->
  <key>KeepAlive</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF
```

.Next, set the correct owner and permissions on the plist:

``` bash
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.karabiner-driverkit.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.karabiner-driverkit.plist
```

.Finally, load and start the LaunchDaemon:

``` bash
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.karabiner-driverkit.plist
sudo launchctl start org.rudimusmaximus.karabiner-driverkit
```

With this in place, the Karabiner DriverKit daemon will run automatically at every boot, ensuring the virtual HID functionality is available whenever you log in.

== Building Kanata (Debug or Release)

Assuming you have cloned the Kanata git repo and installed Rust (we use asdf).

Use Cargo to build either version:

=== Debug build

``` bash
cd ~/project/kanata
cargo build
```

Resulting binary:
`/Users/rudimusmaximus/project/kanata/target/debug/kanata`

=== Release build

``` bash
cd ~/project/kanata
cargo build --release
```

Resulting binary:
`/Users/rudimusmaximus/project/kanata/target/release/kanata`

. **Config File**
Your custom configuration is located at:

`/Users/rudimusmaximus/.config/kanata/home_row_mod_advanced.kbd`

This is fine to keep in your home directory if you only need Kanata *after* you have logged in.

=== Setting up LaunchDaemons (ONLY ONE CAN RUN AT A TIME AS THEY ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE)

You can have separate LaunchDaemons for the debug and release versions of Kanata. Note that LaunchDaemons run *very early*, so if your home directory is encrypted (FileVault), it may not be immediately available. If that doesn’t matter (e.g., you only need Kanata *after* login), it’s fine. Otherwise, consider copying the binary and config to a system path that’s available at boot.
That said, we just point to the binary and config in the LaunchDaemon plist. This way the files stay where they are version managed.

==== Additional one-time setup
You will need to give input monitoring permission in macos under security and privacy settings. I just navigated to the screen, hit plus to browse and add the binary files. They are both named 'kanata' but with slighlty different target paths.

==== Creating Debug LaunchDaemon

Create `/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist`:

``` bash
sudo tee /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist <<EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
<key>Label</key>
<string>org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug</string>

<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
 <!-- Path to your debug binary and config -->
 <string>/Users/rudimusmaximus/project/kanata/target/debug/kanata</string>
 <string>-c</string>
 <string>/Users/rudimusmaximus/.config/kanata/home_row_mod_advanced.kbd</string>
</array>

<key>RunAtLoad</key>
<true/>

<key>KeepAlive</key>
<true/>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF
```

Fix ownership and permissions:

``` bash
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist
```

Load and start:

``` bash
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist
sudo launchctl start org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug
```

==== Creating Release LaunchDaemon (STABLE, I'M USING THIS NOW)

Similarly, create `/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist`:

``` bash
sudo tee /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist <<EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
<key>Label</key>
<string>org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release</string>

<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
 <!-- Path to your release binary and config -->
 <string>/Users/rudimusmaximus/project/kanata/target/release/kanata</string>
 <string>-c</string>
 <string>/Users/rudimusmaximus/.config/kanata/home_row_mod_advanced.kbd</string>
</array>

<key>RunAtLoad</key>
<true/>

<key>KeepAlive</key>
<true/>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF
```

Fix ownership and permissions:

``` bash
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist
```

Load and start:

``` bash
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist
sudo launchctl start org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release
```

== Defining Environment Variables

It’s convenient to define paths in a file like `~/.extra` (or any startup script that your shell sources). For instance:

``` bash
export KANATA_DEBUG_BINARY="$HOME/project/kanata/target/debug/kanata"
export KANATA_RELEASE_BINARY="$HOME/project/kanata/target/release/kanata"
export KANATA_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/kanata/home_row_mod_advanced.kbd"
export KANATA_DEBUG_LAUNCH_DAEMON="/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist"
export KANATA_RELEASE_LAUNCH_DAEMON="/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist"
```

After editing `~/.extra`, either restart your shell or `source ~/.extra` to apply.

== Updating After Code Changes (BOUNCING THE DAEMON)

Note that launchd on macOS will automatically stop when unloading and also start when loading.

So, when you

. **Rebuild** the binary (see earlier section)

. **Unload and reload** the kanata daemon (debug or release):

``` bash
# Unload and it will automatically stop first
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist
# or org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist for debug version

# Load and it will automatically start after
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-release.plist
# or org.rudimusmaximus.kanata-debug.plist for debug version`
```

Now the updated binary is in place, and launchd will run it at boot or on demand.

== A nice home row mod config

I edited the kanata example after trial and error and to get what i like. Hope it inspires you to try something similar.
