= configDotFiles

If already installed, this file is from the bare repo installed in .cfg folder in your $HOME directory. The parent repo is on [github](https://github.com/rudimusmaximus/configDotFiles). Read the **To Use** section for installation instructions.

== Intent

Have a repo from which to setup any new macOS or Linux shell environment with familiar cli experience.

=== How it works

Run the script under To Use section. The files from the repo are copied to your $HOME directory.

Most importantly, a `.bash_profile` sources the `.path`, `.extra`, `.exports` and makes a few other settings before also sourcing the `.bashrc` which itself sources the `.prompt`, `.aliases`, and `.functions` to ensure a consistent experience across interactive and non-interactive shells including SSH sessions.

These various '.files' and folders, divide settings/configurations into logical groups.
This sort of repo is comonly called a dot files repo - hence the repo name, but you will see other variations.

== To use

In a fresh terminal, from your home directory:

```shell script will execute and delete itself
curl -sSf https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rudimusmaximus/cbb877cb5797b00d7fbb9ddc88e7f8b9/raw | bash
```
The script lives in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/rudimusmaximus/cbb877cb5797b00d7fbb9ddc88e7f8b9). Review first if you like.

Any backups of .files that would have been overwritten can be found in .cfg-install.sh
After you restart the terminal, type 'alias' to see our shortcuts. The cursor now has magic powers in git repos. And, nvm is assumed installed. 

The script creates a starter .extra by copying .extra.template to .extra. This file is not committed to the repo.

== Further Considerations

=== Assumed installed

Review the aliases for hints on tools assumed installed. On macOS, prefere Homebrew, download directly from source, or build when necessary after cloning project into a dictory under $HOME/projects. On Fedora, prefer dnf package manager, clone and build in similar directory, or use flatpack as last resort avoiding sources other than say RPM free and non-free.

**Preferred tools**

- nnn as alias `f` for file manager inside terminal
- n directly to then install node and npm lts to start, use n-update to update
- nvim, and it's required prerequisites (see kickstart.nvim or make your own Neovim)
- bun.sh

**AFTER** confDotFiles installation

- complete `.extra` items for ssh, and GitHub AND setup gpg for signing

=== Additional background

See Atlassian's git tutorials for dot files last known (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) for using a bare cloned repo with a clever alias to manage your changes over time.

Our source repo's `.gitignore` includes .cfg to avoid recursive issues and does not include any IDE files.

**TIP** Two aliases are included in the repo to make a git command; type `config` or `cfg` and see the `.aliases` file for
more cfg commands.

TODO: make public after cleaning up commented code 

=== Using with tmux and making changes

Currently, a clean way to work with changes besides the cli aliases is to use lazygit. You
can use either approach or switch between. Here is a workflow:

**tmux workflow using aliases from this repo**

Name it what you like, we use this name for the worktree.

[source,bash]
----
# Create a worktree
$CONFIG_DOT_FILES_GIT_COMMAND worktree add $HOME/configDotFilesWorktree

# Remove worktree (also removes directory)
$CONFIG_DOT_FILES_GIT_COMMAND worktree remove $HOME/configDotFilesWorktree

# Now when you are ready to make changes; stash your work from home
# directory with the alias; it also backs up .extra to .extra.backup
cfgstash

# Then you can open lazygit in the worktree with either of these aliases
configDotFiles
lgcfg

# USING LAZYGIT - it will look like a branch 'configDotFilesWorktree'
# Pop the stash
# Commit and push to 'origin main' using semver (you may have to set the upstream)

# When done, move to your home directory
# and pull to get the latest from origin main
cfg pull
----

=== '.extra' file

'.extra.template' is a template for creating the '.extra' file. This avoids overwrites of changing local
'.extra' file over time.

TODO we need to update the install script and the notes here for treating .extra as a template
so making those changes now.

== LEGAL NOTE

**We're Using GitHub Under Protest**
For our organization, we only use GitHub for private repositories.  We do not recommend it for public or open source work.

We urge you to read about the https://give_up_github.org[Give up GitHub campaign] from https://sfconservancy.org[the Software Freedom Conservancy] to understand
some reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

We are considering https://about.gitlab.com[GitLab] for any open source work we might do in the future.
