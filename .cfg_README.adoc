= configDotFiles

If already installed, this file is from the bare repo installed in .cfg folder in your $HOME directory. The parent repo is on [github](https://github.com/rudimusmaximus/configDotFiles). Read the **To Use** section for installation instructions.

== Intent

Have a repo from which to setup any new macOS or Linux shell environment with familiar cli experience.

=== Tested on

* Bash shell
* Kitty terminal
* macOS Intel and M1 max
* Linux (Fedora Asahi Remix on M1 max)

=== How it works

Run the script under To Use section. The files from the repo are copied to your $HOME directory.

Most importantly, a `.bash_profile` sources the `.path`, `.extra`, `.exports` and makes a few other settings before also sourcing the `.bashrc` which itself sources the `.prompt`, `.aliases`, and `.functions` to ensure a consistent experience across interactive and non-interactive shells including SSH sessions.

These various '.files' and folders, divide settings/configurations into logical groups.
This sort of repository is commonly called a "dot files repository" - hence the name, but you will see other variations, services, and non bare repository approaches.

== To use

In a fresh terminal, from your home directory:

```shell script will execute and delete itself
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudimusmaximus/configDotFiles/refs/heads/main/.cfg_install.sh | bash -s -- -v -h
```
The script lives in [this repository](https://github.com/rudimusmaximus/configDotFiles/blob/main/.cfg_install.sh). Review first if you like.

Any backups of `.files` that would have been overwritten can be found in `.cfg-backup` folder.
After you restart the terminal, type 'alias' or 'aliases' to see our shortcuts. The cursor now has magic powers in git repos. Some aliases assume certain tools are installed.

The script creates a starter .extra by copying .extra.template to .extra. This file is not committed and should be modified with your own settings.

== Further Considerations

=== Assumed installed

Review the aliases for hints on tools assumed installed. On macOS, prefer Homebrew, download directly from source, or build when necessary after cloning project into a directory under $HOME(I use ~/project). On Fedora, prefer dnf package manager, clone and build in similar directory, or use flatpack as last resort avoiding sources other than say RPM free and non-free.

**Preferred tools**

TOOD these tools need to be reviewed and updated; previous list included below.
- nnn as alias `f` for file manager inside terminal
- n directly to then install node and npm lts to start, use n-update to update
- nvim, and it's required prerequisites (see kickstart.nvim or make your own Neovim)
- bun.sh

**AFTER** confDotFiles installation

- complete `.extra` items for ssh, and GitHub AND setup gpg for signing if you sign that way.

=== Additional background

See Atlassian's git tutorials for dot files last known (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) for using a bare cloned repo with a clever alias to manage your changes over time.

Our source repo's `.gitignore` includes .cfg to avoid recursive issues and does not include any IDE files.

**TIP** Two aliases are included in the repo to make a git command; type `config` or `cfg` and see the `.aliases` file for
more cfg commands.

=== Using with tmux and making changes (see cfgstash in .functions)

Currently, a clean way to work with changes besides the cli aliases is to use lazygit. You
can use either approach or switch between. The install script has flages for -b and -c for bare repo in home and optionally clone of configDotFiles repo.

==== tmux

Install tmux with brew on macOS or dnf on Fedora. Then clone it's package manager and source the tmux configuration file we installed with these dot files.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
----

Run tmux and use the conf by leader + capital I which is <ctrl> + S followed by pressing shift + I. This will install the plugins in the .tmux.conf file.

**tmux workflow using aliases from this repo**

If you want to use lazy git, run the install -c to install the actual repo in HOME/configDotFiles so you can use any tool you like. Just push to remote when done
and cfg pull to get the updates.

Take care between working via cli cfg alias or in the actual repo. Obviously don't work in .cfg bare clone.

`cfgstash` is included in .functions for saving work if any in HOME dir and also backing up the local .extra file.

[source,bash]
----

# Now when you are ready to make changes; stash your work from home
# directory with the alias; it also backs up .extra to .extra.backup
cfgstash

# Then you can open lazygit in the actual repository with either of these aliases
# additionally you can learn about tmuxifier for tmux layouts
# if you have tmux setup you can run these aliases to open tmuxifier layout
configDotFiles

# USING LAZYGIT - it will look like a branch 'configDotFilesWorktree'
# Pop the stash
# Commit and push to 'origin main' using semver (you may have to set the upstream)
# TODO verify best way to sync with remote and local .cfg and home directories

# When done, move to your home directory
# and pull to get the latest from origin main
cfg pull
----

The included ./.lazygit_config_template.yml is a template for lazygit and has instructions via comment inside that file. The cool part for this is that in diff view inside lazygit you can click on a file's line number and edit the file at that location in your configured $EDITOR.

As long as you brew install git-delta, the .extra file can be edited to create the recommended detla settings for your .gitconfig

.Section for configuring git-delta from your .extra file
[source,bash]
----
# This section makes delta the default pager for Git (expects available via brew install git-delta)
# See https://github.com/dandavison/delta
# Setting Git configuration for delta and related diff options
git config --global core.pager delta

git config --global interactive.diffFilter "delta --color-only"

git config --global delta.navigate true       # use n and N to move between diff sections
git config --global delta.light false         # set to true if you're in a terminal with a light background
git config --global delta.line-numbers true

git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

git config --global diff.colorMoved default
----

=== '.extra' file

'.extra.template' is a template for creating the '.extra' file. This avoids overwrites of changing local
'.extra' file over time. Use `cfgstash` to backup '.extra' and stash any current uncommitted changes in the home directory.

=== Recent refactor improving login vs non interactive shells

The .bashrc and .bash_profile were mac centric in the treating of every new session was a log in session starting with the bash profile and then sourcing the bashrc. The reasoning was to minimuze duplicate work and separate things done once per session from things done every new shell like tabs for example. We noticed issues with path not being equal in new tmux sessions or on fedora and also that ssh utilities would have problems which we tried to work around. This new refactor pushes the files loaded into the bash profile and makes the profile just call the bashrc. Much simpler. Since the rework is negligible in performance, we needed to make sure the path would not keep growing so we worked some helper functions to prepend and postpend the path and not add duplicates. This should allow for consisntent and less troublesome experience across environments and be more consistent with the rest of the unix and linux worlds.
TODO areas to test:
- macos with and without tmux
- fedora with and without tmux
- ssh with and without tmux
- that asdf shim paths are not shadowed by macos paths in checkhealth for nvim namely with python version and also not catching asdf runtimes like java checkhealth requirements and others

**We're Using GitHub Under Protest.** For our organization, we mostly use GitHub for private repositories.  We do not recommend it for public or open source work. This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS projects.

We urge you to read about the https://GiveUpGitHub.org[Give up GitHub campaign] from https://sfconservancy.org[the Software Freedom Conservancy] to understand
some reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

We are considering other options for any open source work we might do in the future.
