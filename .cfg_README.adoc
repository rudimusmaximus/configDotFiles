= configDotFiles

If already installed, this file is from the bare repo installed in .cfg folder in your $HOME directory. The parent repo is on [github](https://github.com/rudimusmaximus/configDotFiles). Read the **To Use** section for installation instructions.

== Intent

Have a repo from which to setup any new macOS or Linux shell environment with familiar cli experience.

=== How it works

Run the script under To Use section. The files from the repo are copied to your $HOME directory.

Most importantly, a `.bash_profile` sources the `.path`, `.extra`, `.exports` and makes a few other settings before also sourcing the `.bashrc` which itself sources the `.prompt`, `.aliases`, and `.functions` to ensure a consistent experience across interactive and non-interactive shells including SSH sessions.

These various '.files' and folders, divide settings/configurations into logical groups.
This sort of repository is commonly called a "dot files repository" - hence the name, but you will see other variations, services, and non bare repository approaches.

== To use

In a fresh terminal, from your home directory:

```shell script will execute and delete itself
curl -sSf https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rudimusmaximus/cbb877cb5797b00d7fbb9ddc88e7f8b9/raw | bash -s -- -v -h
```
The script lives in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/rudimusmaximus/cbb877cb5797b00d7fbb9ddc88e7f8b9). Review first if you like.

Any backups of `.files` that would have been overwritten can be found in `.cfg-backup` folder.
After you restart the terminal, type 'alias' or 'aliases' to see our shortcuts. The cursor now has magic powers in git repos. Some aliases assume certain tools are installed.

The script creates a starter .extra by copying .extra.template to .extra. This file is not committed and should be modified with your own settings.

== Further Considerations

=== Assumed installed

Review the aliases for hints on tools assumed installed. On macOS, prefer Homebrew, download directly from source, or build when necessary after cloning project into a directory under $HOME(I use ~/project). On Fedora, prefer dnf package manager, clone and build in similar directory, or use flatpack as last resort avoiding sources other than say RPM free and non-free.

**Preferred tools**

TOOD these tools need to be reviewed and updated; previous list included below.
- nnn as alias `f` for file manager inside terminal
- n directly to then install node and npm lts to start, use n-update to update
- nvim, and it's required prerequisites (see kickstart.nvim or make your own Neovim)
- bun.sh

**AFTER** confDotFiles installation

- complete `.extra` items for ssh, and GitHub AND setup gpg for signing if you sign that way.

=== Additional background

See Atlassian's git tutorials for dot files last known (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) for using a bare cloned repo with a clever alias to manage your changes over time.

Our source repo's `.gitignore` includes .cfg to avoid recursive issues and does not include any IDE files.

**TIP** Two aliases are included in the repo to make a git command; type `config` or `cfg` and see the `.aliases` file for
more cfg commands.

=== Using with tmux and making changes (see cfgstash in .functions)

Currently, a clean way to work with changes besides the cli aliases is to use lazygit. You
can use either approach or switch between. The install script creates a directory which is a worktree at $HOME/configDotFilesWorktree. Here is info on setting up and using tmux long with workflow notes for reference.

==== tmux

Install tmux with brew on macOS or dnf on Fedora. Then clone it's package manager and source the tmux configuration file we installed with these dot files.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
----

**tmux workflow using aliases from this repo**

Name it what you like, we use this name for the worktree.

[source,bash]
----
# Create a worktree
$CONFIG_DOT_FILES_GIT_COMMAND worktree add $HOME/configDotFilesWorktree

# Remove worktree (also removes directory)
$CONFIG_DOT_FILES_GIT_COMMAND worktree remove $HOME/configDotFilesWorktree

# Now when you are ready to make changes; stash your work from home
# directory with the alias; it also backs up .extra to .extra.backup
cfgstash

# Then you can open lazygit in the worktree with either of these aliases
# additionally you can learn about tmuxifier for tmux layouts
configDotFiles
lgcfg

# USING LAZYGIT - it will look like a branch 'configDotFilesWorktree'
# Pop the stash
# Commit and push to 'origin main' using semver (you may have to set the upstream)
# TODO verify best way to sync with remote and local .cfg and home directories

# When done, move to your home directory
# and pull to get the latest from origin main
cfg pull

----

The included ./.lazygit_config_template.yml is a template for lazygit and has instructions via comment inside that file. The cool part for this is that in diff view inside lazygit you can click on a file's line number and edit the file at that location in your configured $EDITOR.
TODO include setting up Delta in lazygit

=== Setting Upstream

Make sure your worktree is tracking `main` properly. Follow these steps to set up the upstream:

1. Go to the worktree directory and check out the `main` branch.
2. Run a fetch to get the `main` branch from `origin`.

[source,bash]
----

git checkout main
# Fetch the `main` branch from the remote
git fetch origin main:origin/main

----

3. Set the upstream for the `main` branch.

[source,bash]
----

# Set the upstream for the `main` branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main

----

4. Confirm the upstream has been set correctly.

[source,bash]
----

# Verify the upstream tracking
git status -sb

----

You should see the following output to confirm proper tracking:

[source,bash]
----

## main...origin/main

----


=== '.extra' file

'.extra.template' is a template for creating the '.extra' file. This avoids overwrites of changing local
'.extra' file over time.

some reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

We are considering other options for any open source work we might do in the future.
