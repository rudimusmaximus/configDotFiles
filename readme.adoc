== LEGAL NOTE

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

**We're Using GitHub Under Protest.** For our organization, we mostly use GitHub for private repositories.  We do not recommend it for public or open source work. This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS projects.

We urge you to read about the https://GiveUpGitHub.org[Give up GitHub campaign] from https://sfconservancy.org[the Software Freedom Conservancy] to understand
some reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

We are considering other options for any future open source offered to the public.
