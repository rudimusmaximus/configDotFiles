# TIPs

1. Add detail as necessary and include issue numbers by # notation if there are any
2. Review complexity and priority labels; select estimate story point number if we are tracking in a sprint
3. As the question is answered, add any checkbox tasks we need to track or for you do break down subtasks

- [x] Subtask example

4. When the group is satisfied with an answer, update the **Final Answer** section making sure checkbox tasks if any are completed
5. Add the Label `FIXED` and move to your required repo pipeline (usually review or done)
6. DO NOT CLOSE the issue as we may want to see them in GloBoards and we only close in ZenHub

**ALSO:** See [GitHub's Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for advice on using markdown styling.
