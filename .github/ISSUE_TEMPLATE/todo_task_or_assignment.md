# TIPs

1. Add detail as necessary and include issue numbers by # notation if there are any
2. Review complexity and priority labels; select estimate story point number if we are tracking in a sprint
3. As the task is completed, add any checkbox tasks if we need to track subtasks

- [x] Subtask example

4. When the assigned person is done, add the Label `FIXED` and move to `Review/QA` pipeline
5. DO NOT CLOSE the issue as we may want to see them in GloBoards and we only close in ZenHub

**ALSO:** See [GitHub's Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for advice on using markdown styling.
