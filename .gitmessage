subjectLineType: vSemVerIteration_oneSpace_ShortTitle

# Types are {feat fix docs style refactor test chore} with
# an empty line after the subject line
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so.
#
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other non-intuitive consequences of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.
#
# - Bullet points are okay, too
#
# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
# by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
# vary here
#
# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
# like this and auto close if applicable using a close word
# {"closeWord #issueNum" - close, closes, closed, fixes, fixed}
#
# Partial #123, fixes #222, fixes #333
# In this example, partial would not get closed.
#
# TIP - GitHub issue close language anywhere in commit message
# will close only once the commit is merged into the default branch
# (usually main or master). Also, when merged into non default branch,
# the issue will be marked with a tooltip in GitHub. Because we practice
# 'git flow', feature branches go into a 'develop' branch, so we can
# use this auto-close language while moving issues into a review/QA
# pipeline/column. WHEN creating releases, check review items so
# they can safely auto close on merge to main.
#
# See also #number, #anotherIssue OR no line at all
